                Until not long ago, I used to put in little to no effort into
                studies. Yet, I always got good grades, no matter what. Now,
                however, things have changed. I strive to get as far as I can
                into my field, and am willing to invest whatever amount of
                effort it takes to do so.<br /><br />

                As a student, my life has been quite eventful. Before COVID hit,
                I was known for my cunning "pranks" (the exact words in one of
                my report cards). Even though I was strong academically, my
                personality spoiled it all.<br /><br />

                I am yet to understand what occurred during COVID, but something
                changed me completely. During online classes (despite
                programming and not paying attention), I used to get good grades
                for my discipline.<br /><br />

                When I entered tenth grade, I had changed to the point of
                unrecognisability. I impressed myself by actually changing
                others' ideas about me, hence disproving the saying that "the
                first impression is the last impression".<br /><br />

                I changed schools when I passed to eleventh grade, and the
                "demonic" picture of myself was ripped to shreds. I got to start
                anew, and I did so pretty well.<br /><br />

                Currently, all my reports stand in praise of me, all my teachers
                trust me and consider me to be "sincere" (I'm not sure I can
                call myself that). I have always had that "quiet kid" kind of
                personality at school ever since, and I would certainly like to
                keep it up.<br /><br />
