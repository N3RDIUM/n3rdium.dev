                Hobbies? I honestly don't know where to get started.<br /><br />

                I am absolutely hooked to amateur astronomy and
                astrophotography. I might be inexperienced, but I have known
                myself to be quite resilient at times. When I finally achieve
                what I was hoping for, the satisfaction it brings me knows no
                bounds. Merely looking at a clear sky can get me all hyped
                up.<br /><br />

                I love to code. I started programming in Python during the COVID
                lockdown, and got hooked almost immediately. Being honest here,
                I've been caught working on my code projects while attending
                online classes several times (and was punished for it)!<br /><br />

                Life is nothing to me without music. It has surrounded me since
                I was born, since a sizeable portion of my family is into music.
                I, however, chose a different path in the vast melodic sea: the
                Piano. I have been a piano addict since 2023, and will continue
                being one for the rest of my life. Before the piano, I used to
                play many other instuments (some of them I still do), which
                include the Tabla, Flute, Mouth Organ and Harmonium.<br /><br />

                Of course, the list would be incomplete without my favourite
                sport, Badminton, although it is an uncommon choice among my
                current peers. I undergo professional training in badminton at
                the local court almost everyday.<br /><br />

                I'm also into creative writing: I'm writing a series of science
                fiction novels. No spoilers here, of course!<br /><br />
