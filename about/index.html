                <p>
                    Hey there! I'm <span class="username-span">n3rdium</span>.
                    Welcome to my hideout! I'm a 
                    <strong>17-year-old</strong>
                    <strong>amateur astronomer</strong>,
                    <strong>programmer</strong> and
                    <strong>self-taught pianist</strong>
                    from Planet Earth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I was around third grade, I was obsessed with space,
                    and science in general. Nothing that I know of intrigues
                    me more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Around the time when COVID hit, I started to gain interest
                    in programming. Computers started to seem like a second
                    world to me—one where I had the power to make anything (and
                    break anything, too).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although I find humans interesting, too, computers have
                    their own allure. They do <i>exactly</i> as I tell them to.
                    Probably the only entities that don't misunderstand me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being an amateur astronomer, it is natural for me to be
                    obsessed with telescopes, optics, cameras and the like.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have been surrounded by music for all my life. I tried several
                    instruments before finally settling onto the piano. My
                    favourite composer has to be Chopin.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Managing my multiple interests is difficult—but it is the
                    <i>fun</i> kind of difficult. I usually try to <i>
                    integrate</i> multiple skills into my projects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A bit more about about my username: It both <i>is</i> 
                    and <i>isn't</i> case-sensitive. It can be either 
                    <strong>all-caps or all lowercase</strong>, 
                    but <i>not anywhere in between.</i> 
                    i.e. there are only two "valid" versions of my 
                    username: <span class="username-span">n3rdium</span>
                    and <span class="username-span">N3RDIUM</span>.
