                        Let's face it. There's at least one programming language
                        we all hate, and sometimes we're even forced to deal
                        with it (myself included). TODO <br /><br />

                        I present to you HashN: a language built for LLMs. It's
                        just a concept that zenned its way into my mind. I
                        haven't had the time (or resources, for that matter) to
                        test this on actual LLMs, so I don't know how well it'll
                        work. I'd be thrilled if someone has the time and
                        resources to actually pull this off. <br /><br />

                        Alright, enough rambling. Let's get right into the
                        concept. Basically, all written languages (afaik) have
                        certain inconsistencies which make them hard for
                        computers to understand. <br /><br />

                        There are several instances of this. My favourites have
                        to be these extracts from the Jargon File: <br /><br />

                        <pre>
It has been observed that many hackers are confused by negative questions — or, at least, that the people to whom they are talking are often confused by the sense of their answers. The problem is that they have done so much programming that distinguishes between

    if (going) ...

and

    if (!going) ...

that when they parse the question “Aren't you going?” it may seem to be asking the opposite question from “Are you going?”, and so to merit an answer in the opposite sense. This confuses English-speaking non-hackers because they were taught to answer as though the negative part weren't there. In some other languages (including Russian, Chinese, and Japanese) the hackish interpretation is standard and the problem wouldn't arise. Hackers often find themselves wishing for a word like French ‘si’, German ‘doch’, or Dutch ‘jawel’ — a word with which one could unambiguously answer ‘yes’ to a negative question.</pre
