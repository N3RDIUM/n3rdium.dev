                            Greetings from planet Earth. In this series of posts, I
                            will share with you the progress I have made with the 
                            AstroPi project. Yeah, that's what I'm calling it as of
                            now.

                            Legendary astrophotographers have proved that even 
                            webcams can be used to capture some stunning 
                            astrophotography. However, I've only seen planetary
                            images (do tell me if you find any DSOs!).

                        <p>
                            I've been doing phone astrophotography for quite a
                            while, now, and it really goes to show how powerful
                            today's camera sensors are, despite their size. Feel
                            free to check out the "Astro" section of this site!
                            As of today, all of the images posted there have
                            been captured using a phone camera or similar sensor.
