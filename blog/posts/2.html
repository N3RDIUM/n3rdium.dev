                            Greetings from planet Earth. In this series of posts, I
                            will share with you the progress I have made with the 
                            AstroPi project. Yeah, that's what I'm calling it as of
                            now.

                        <h2>What's the big idea?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Legendary astrophotographers have proved that even 
                            webcams can be used to capture some stunning 
                            astrophotography. However, I've only seen planetary
                            images (do tell me if you find any DSOs!).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've been doing phone astrophotography for quite a
                            while, now, and it really goes to show how powerful
                            today's camera sensors are, despite their size. Feel
                            free to check out the "Astro" section of this site!
                            As of today, all of the images posted there have
                            been captured using a phone camera or similar sensor.

                            Long story short, I want to take it to the next level 
                            by using a
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://raspberrypi.com">Raspberry Pi</a>
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/">HQ Camera</a>.
                            I also plan to write my own control software in python.

                        <h2>How?!</h2>
                        <p>
                            Basically, an M12-to-1.25" adapter will be used to
                            connect the HQ camera to the telescope's focuser.
                            The camera will, of course, will be controlled using
                            a Raspberry Pi 5. To control things, a Flask server
                            will be hosted on the Raspberry Pi, which hosts HTML
                            pages. That's the idea.

                            I haven't yet decided what I'm going to do about the
                            casing, but I guess I won't be worrying about that
                            just yet. For now, I'm going for a random plastic
                            box that happened to be lying around.

                            Not much is required to build your own AstroPi
                            (subject to change once I add a cooling system!).
                            Just a Raspberry Pi, and the HQ Camera.
