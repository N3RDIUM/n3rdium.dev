                            I, having stumbled upon it, am willing to share it with 
                            you in this short but hopefully transformative blog post.

                            Most of us look at studying as this brick wall that one
                            has to either climb, or (if one is strong enough), break
                            through. I absolutely disagree. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It is a tragedy that so many people with such great 
                            potential never get the chance to rise, just because of 
                            this one misunderstanding.
                        </p>

                            The things mentioned in this post are not necessarily
                            specific to the process of studying and can be applied
                            to just about anything that involves hard work and working
                            at the very edge of your abilities.

                        <h2>The Killer Misunderstanding</h2>

                        <p>
                            Nearly everywhere, I've heard about how you can
                            "<b>force</b> yourself" or "<b>trick</b> your brain" into
                            studying hard <i>to get good grades</i>. While these methods
                            may work, I don't think using them is going to get me
                            anywhere in the long run.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Until not long ago, I had been thinking the same. Where has
                            that got me? Absolutely nowhere. I consider the progress I
                            made in the previous years insignificant. Vanishingly small.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Why do people think that studying is some kind of inevitable
                            chore? Why can't we just... <i>enjoy the process?!</i> That's
                            right. Studying can be just as enjoyable as sports or music
                            or just about anything else.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Alright, here's the big part. Drop all your previous
                            assumptions about study. It'll do you good to just forget
                            what studying (whatever that means) is for a while.
                        </p>
