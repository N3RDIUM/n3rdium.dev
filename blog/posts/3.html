                        <h2>What Is Vibe Coding?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Vibe coding treats the "coding" part like a black box
                            (i don't know why it's even part of the name). It's all about
                            the <i>vibes</i>. Here's how the process goes:
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>You prompt an AI to make something.</li>
                            <li>Most of the time, it writes garbage code which you <i>definitely</i> don't understand.</li>
                            <li>You ask the AI to fix it.</li>
                            <li>This creates several <i>other</i> problems with the "codebase", seldom fixing the <i>actual</i> problem.</i>
                            <li>Go back to step 3</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>
                            In the end, it's a recursive, never-ending process. It only ends
                            when YOU change your expectations to something more lowly or
                            get frustrated and decide to KEEP the bugs. That is, assuming the
                            code <i>does</i> run (or compile).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Well, one thing's certain: it's definitely not getting you hired.
                            Even if you WERE hired, you're probably getting fired soon. I'd be
                            scared if this isn't the case.
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <h2>Why Is Vibe Coding Hated?</h2>
                        <p>
                            I mean, there isn't anything wrong or illegal with it,
                            <i>right</i>? But, if the big boys are against it, there's
                            definitely a reason.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            And the reason is: pure vibes just don't make the cut. Programming,
                            <i>good</i> programming, is a skill to be learnt. Asking an AI to do
                            it for you, treating the codebase like a black box, not even caring
                            to look at the code for once, you're gaining nothing from it in the 
                            long run. Actually, you're not <i>coding</i> at all!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It may be cheaper than hiring a <i>real</i> developer, you might have
                            the ability to make it work 24/7 (if you have the money), but that's
                            just about it. The cons more than outweigh the pros.
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <h2>Is It Bad To Use AI For Programming?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Who said? There's no harm in using it as a rubber duck. No one's
                            stopping you from using it to help you name things. GitHub Copilot
                            (i <i>used to</i> use it too, but not now) does an okay-ish job
                            at helping you avoid repetitive tasks.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Basically, anything that doesn't require critical thinking or involve
                            writing code.
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>
                            We're not in danger (yet). It's okay to use AI, but not for the bit
                            where you write the code.
                        </p>
