                            A lot (three) of my friends asked me how I made this website.
                            Some even suspect me of 
                            <a target="_blank" href="/blog/posts/3.html">Vibe Coding</a>
                            it. Did I, really? Read on to find out!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Despite what it looks like, this <i>isn't</i> your average
                            static html-and-css site. There's a good few things going on
                            under the hood (no, I'm not talking about google analytics).
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <h2>The Beginning?</h2>
                        <p>
                            About three years ago, I randomly decided that I wanted to have
                            my own website. I put together a sloppy little homepage. I didn't
                            like the way it looked. So I did some more design. I <i>still</i>
                            didn't like it, appearance-wise. So I did some more tweaking.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The process continued for quite a while. Then, I just ditched all
                            my work and started building a <i>new</i> homepage design. After
                            <i>months</i> of going through several remakes (some of which
                            actually looked kind of impressive), I had made little progress.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Then, I decided (I don't remember when) that I'm supposed to build
                            <strong>a website</strong>, a <i>real</i> one at that. Not a
                            <i>perfect</i> one. And if it's real, it's bound to have flaws.
                            That's what it took to actually build this website.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <h2>Under The Hood</h2>
                        <p>
                            This site is hosted on GitHub Pages. Yes, it's static HTML, CSS and
                            some JS. But you see, that's just <i>half</i> the picture.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I've made a hacky little redirect system at <code>/r</code>. Which
                            is why,
                            <a target="_blank" href="/r?id=genuine">do not click this link.</a>
                            You have been warned!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Every time update this website, a GitHub Action triggers. If you'll
                            head over to the 
                            <a target="_blank" href="/r?id=source">GitHub Repo</a>
                            for this site, you'll find a few <code>index.json</code>s in the
                            directories, as well as a <code>robots.txt</code>. You'll also find
                            an <code>update.py</code>, which is actually run by the Action I
                            mentioned earlier.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The <code>update.py</code> file is where most of the magic happens.
                            It updates the indexes and the <code>robots.txt</code> file 
                            automatically. Yes, I could've just used Wordpress, but that wouldn't
                            be very fun.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>
                            This isn't the most professional website. But it's minimalistic.
                            It's hand-made, most of the files hand-written in neovim.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you're making something, don't repeat my mistakes. Seriously.
                            If you want to really kick off the launchpad, keep this in mind.
                            <i>You don't need to be perfect. You only need to be real.</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>Speaking of
                            neovim, in the next post, I'm taking you on a guided tour of my

                            I've also been working on a lightweight voice assistant for the
