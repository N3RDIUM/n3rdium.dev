# N3RDIUM
Hey there! This is my portfolio website and blog. Not much to see here, is there?
The website is [here](https://n3rdium.dev).

TODOs:
- [ ] Add more TODOs? 😅
- [ ] Astro image zoom-in/desc page: redux
- [ ] Update site structure. Must include piano stuff. Going to need those list pages more, not just on blog. Maybe use one of those dropdown navs (sidebar on mobile).
- [ ] Do a scroll to top button in the bottom right corner for all scrollable pages.
- [ ] Update frequency entries in the sitemap.
- [ ] Blog: add table of contents.
- [ ] Skills: add chess +elo, human languages, subjects of interest/courses equiv, npm, yarn, react native, expo/snack, ollama, badminton, GIMP, Siril, DSS, MSICE, p5js, mpv, glsl, tkinter, pyqt5, qtdesigner, cargo, llms/prompting, stable diffusion/sdxl, google colab
- [ ] New sub: host my projects' docs, etc. on `/projects/`. Changelogs will be included on the regular blog along with posts, like what vaxry does. Projects that may require this: PyTaskbar, AstroPi, zen, mnmlst, voxl, foom, rubberducky (archive later or will be superseded by zen), webcraft (first gamedev experiment?).
- [ ] Projects will host their own sites on `projectname.n3rdium.dev` from respective repositories.
- [ ] Write proper readmes for projects and link here.
- [ ] New project: easily add a comments section anywhere! Make use of it on this site. Integrate with Akismet.
- [x] Fix a lot of SEO stuff.
- [x] Make dynamic lists in js and add fuzzy search(Fuse.js). "All caught up!" instead of "Stay tuned for more". 
- [x] Redirect system: use 302 redirects using meta and link instead of that hacky thing. Or HTML meta redirects.
- [x] Blog: estimated reading time. Pypkg `readtime`
- [x] Site RSS/Atom feed for astro, projects/updates, blog posts, etc. Pypkg `feedgen`
- [x] Move pages: `/skills/` -> `/about/skills/` and fill the remaining nav space with `/projects/`. Or better, make space for SIX nav items instead (font size -). Or EVEN BETTER, don't display the nav entry of the page you're currently on.
