# N3RDIUM
Hey there! This is my portfolio website and blog. Not much to see here, is there?
The website is [here](https://n3rdium.dev).

TODOs:
- [ ] Add more TODOs? 😅
- [ ] Update site structure. Must include piano stuff. Going to need those list pages more, not just on blog. Make dynamic lists in js() and add fuzzy search(Fuse.js). "All caught up!" instead of "Stay tuned for more". Also do a scroll to top button in the bottom right corner for all scrollable pages.
- [ ] Update frequency entries in the sitemap.
- [ ] Blog post: Making a website from scratch in 2025. Because the other two posts didn't do it justice. Or rewrite the other two posts. Include that the star pattern on the homepage changes everytime the site is deployed.
- [ ] Blog: add table of contents.
- [ ] Skills: add chess +elo, human languages, subjects of interest/courses equiv, npm, yarn, react native, expo/snack, ollama, badminton, GIMP, Siril, DSS, MSICE, p5js, mpv, glsl, tkinter, pyqt5, qtdesigner, cargo
- [ ] New sub: host my projects' docs, etc. on `/projects/`. Changelogs will be included on the regular blog along with posts, like what vaxry does. Projects that may require this: PyTaskbar, AstroPi, zen, mnmlst, voxl, foom, rubberducky (archive later or will be superseded by zen), webcraft (first gamedev experiment?).
- [ ] Projects will host their own sites on `projectname.n3rdium.dev` from respective repositories.
- [ ] Fix a lot of SEO stuff. Write proper readmes for projects and link here.
- [ ] New project: easily add a comments section anywhere! Make use of it on this site. Integrate with Akismet.
- [x] Redirect system: use 302 redirects using meta and link instead of that hacky thing. Or HTML meta redirects.
- [x] Blog: estimated reading time. Pypkg `readtime`
- [x] Site RSS/Atom feed for astro, projects/updates, blog posts, etc. Pypkg `feedgen`
- [x] Move pages: `/skills/` -> `/about/skills/` and fill the remaining nav space with `/projects/`. Or better, make space for SIX nav items instead (font size -). Or EVEN BETTER, don't display the nav entry of the page you're currently on.
- [x] Skills: highlight things being learnt
- [x] Fix the gallery page for mobile devices
- [x] Add alt text in the astro image index
- [x] GitHub Action w/ py script to auto-update the sitemap and post json files
- [x] Make the entire site gruvbox.
- [x] Limit the content width in the about pages
- [x] Fix the y-size of your homepage on mobile devices
- [x] Complete the about page
- [x] Add all your astrophotography (as WEBP) with good descriptions
- [x] Make the blog page
- [x] Make the contact page
- [x] Make the projects page
