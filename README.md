# N3RDIUM
Hey there! This is my portfolio website and blog. Not much to see here, is there?
The website is [here](https://n3rdium.dev).

TODOs:
- [ ] Add more TODOs? 😅
- [ ] Update frequency entries in the sitemap.
- [ ] Site RSS/Atom feed for astro, projects/updates, blog posts, etc.
- [ ] Blog post: Making a website from scratch in 2025. Because the other two posts didn't do it justice.
- [ ] Blog: add table of contents and estimated reading time.
- [ ] Skills: add chess +elo, human languages, subjects of interest/courses equiv, npm, yarn, react native, expo/snack, ollama, badminton, GIMP, Siril, DSS, MSICE, p5js, mpv, glsl, tkinter, pyqt5, qtdesigner, cargo
- [ ] New sub: host my projects' docs, etc. on `/projects/`. Changelogs will be included on the regular blog along with posts, like what vaxry does. Projects that may require this: PyTaskbar, AstroPi, zen, mnmlst, voxl, foom, rubberducky (archive later or will be superseded by zen), webcraft (first gamedev experiment?).
- [ ] Fix a lot of SEO stuff. Write proper readmes for projects and link here.
- [x] Move pages: `/skills/` -> `/about/skills/` and fill the remaining nav space with `/projects/`. Or better, make space for SIX nav items instead (font size -). Or EVEN BETTER, don't display the nav entry of the page you're currently on.
- [x] Skills: highlight things being learnt
- [x] Fix the gallery page for mobile devices
- [x] Add alt text in the astro image index
- [x] GitHub Action w/ py script to auto-update the sitemap and post json files
- [x] Make the entire site gruvbox.
- [x] Limit the content width in the about pages
- [x] Fix the y-size of your homepage on mobile devices
- [x] Complete the about page
- [x] Add all your astrophotography (as WEBP) with good descriptions
- [x] Make the blog page
- [x] Make the contact page
